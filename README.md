<h4 align="center">A Flamework networking mod designed to the same thing but worse</h4>

## ✨ Featuring

🌉 Gateways - Handle remote events and functions with classes

🛡️ Guards - Block certain requests before they are processed

🤣 Pipes - Transform and validate parameters passed to requests

💐 Decorators - I want decorators

## 🌻 Motivation

I prefer my packages unfinished and unstable. But when I ran `npm install @flamework/networking` and saw high-quality code, I absolutely knew that things had to change.

`flamework-gateways-mod` makes sure to provide only the dumbest learning curves. It is designed to look like, but fall short of, objectively better solutions.

## 🔌 Installation

```
npm install @flamework/core@modding
npm install -D rbxts-transformer-flamework@modding
```

```
npm install @rbxts/flamework-gateways-mod
```

## 📚 Examples

### 🌉 Gateway
```ts
@Gateway({
  guards: [new AdminGuard(["littensy"])],
})
class MyGateway {
  @OnEvent()
  @UsePipes([], UppercasePipe)
  async onSend(player: Player, value: string) {
    print(`${player.Name} said ${value}`);
  }

  @OnInvoke()
  async getMeaningOfLife(player: Player, _test: string) {
    return 42;
  }
}
```

### 🛡️ Guard
```ts
class AdminGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private readonly admins: Array<string>) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext) 
    return this.admins.includes(context.getPlayer().Name);
  }
}
```


### 🤣 Pipe
```ts
class UppercasePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: unknown) {
    assert(typeIs(value, "string"), "(UppercasePipe) Value must be a string");
    return value.upper();
  }
}
```

## Limitations

`flamework-gateways-mod` may spontaneously stop working, or fail to begin with. This note will be removed when it's stable
